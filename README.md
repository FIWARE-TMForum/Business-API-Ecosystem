## Background

This is the main repository of the Business API Ecosystem. This project is part
of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org), and has been developed in collaboration
with the [TM Forum](https://www.tmforum.org/). Check also the
[FIWARE Catalogue entry for the Business API Ecosystem](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/business-api-ecosystem-biz-ecosystem-ri)!

The Business API Ecosystem is not a single software repository, but it is
composed of different projects which work coordinate to provide the complete
functionality.

Concretely, the Business API Ecosystem is made of the following components:

-   Reference implementations of TM Forum APIs.

    -   [Catalog Management API](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/DSPRODUCTCATALOG2)
    -   [Product Ordering Management API](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/DSPRODUCTORDERING)
    -   [Product Inventory Management API](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/DSPRODUCTINVENTORY)
    -   [Party Management API](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/DSPARTYMANAGEMENT)
    -   [Customer Management API](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/DSCUSTOMER)
    -   [Billing Management API](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/DSBILLINGMANAGEMENT)
    -   [Usage Management API](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/DSUSAGEMANAGEMENT)

-   Rating, Charging, and Billing backend.

    -   [Charging Backend](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/business-ecosystem-charging-backend)

-   Revenue Settlement and Sharing System.

    -   [RSS](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/business-ecosystem-rss)

-   Authentication, API Orchestrator, and Web portal.
    -   [Logic Proxy](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/business-ecosystem-logic-proxy)

### Are there any legal issues with AGPL 3.0? Is it safe for me to use?

There is absolutely no problem in using a product licensed under AGPL 3.0. Issues with GPL 
(or AGPL) licenses are mostly related with the fact that different people assign different 
interpretations on the meaning of the term “derivate work” used in these licenses. Due to this,
some people believe that there is a risk in just _using_ software under GPL or AGPL licenses
(even without _modifying_ it).

For the avoidance of doubt, the owners of this software licensed under an AGPL 3.0 license  
wish to make a clarifying public statement as follows:

> Please note that software derived as a result of modifying the source code of this
> software in order to fix a bug or incorporate enhancements is considered a derivative 
> work of the product. Software that merely uses or aggregates (i.e. links to) an otherwise 
> unmodified version of existing software is not considered a derivative work, and therefore
> it does not need to be released as under the same license, or even released as open source.
