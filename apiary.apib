# FIWARE TMF Business API Ecosystem

The Business API Ecosystem is a joint component made up of the FIWARE Business Framework
and a set of APIs (and its reference implementations) provided by the TMForum.
This component allows the monetization of different kind of assets (both digital and physical)
during the whole service life cycle, from offering creation to its charging, accounting and
revenue settlement and sharing. The Business API Ecosystem exposes its complete functionality
through TMForum standard APIs; concretely, it includes the catalog management, ordering management,
inventory management, usage management, billing, customer, and party APIs.

## Specification

### Authentication

Each HTTP request against the Business API Ecosystem API requires the inclusion of specific authentication credentials. The specific implementation of this API may support multiple authentication schemes (OAuth, Basic Auth, Token) and will be determined by the specific provider that implements the GE. Please contact the provider to determine the best way to authenticate against this API. Remember that some authentication schemes may require that the API operates using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS).

The reference implementation of the Business API Ecosystem provides support for Cookie, and OAuth2 authentication, being OAuth2 the default in FIWARE Lab.

### Synchronous Faults

Error responses will be encoded using the most appropriated <code>content-type</code> in base to the <code>Accept</code> header of the request.

JSON Example


    {
        "error": "No JSON object could be decoded",
    }


XML Example


    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <error>No JSON object could be decoded</error>


### Used HTTP Codes


| HTTP Code | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|------------ |
| 200 | OK | Your request has been completed properly |
| 201 | Created | Your resource has been created.|
| 204 | No content | Your request has been processed, but a response is not available. Generally used when deleting entities|
| 400 | Bad Request | The content of your request is not correct |
| 401 | Unauthorized | You are not logged in or the Authorization token you are providing is not valid |

# Group Asset Type Management API

API for the management of asset types. These asset types represent the different kind of digital assets that can be validated, managed, and activated by the system.
The different asset types are included in the system  by the admins, who can install them as plugins.

This API manages the following fields:

* **id** - id in the system of the asset type
* **href** - URL pointing to the asset type info
* **name** - Name of the asset type
* **author** - Author of the installed plugin that implements the asset type
* **version** - Version of the plugin that implements the asset type
* **mediaTypes** - List of media types that are valid when provided an asset of the given type. If this field is empty, any media type is allowed
* **formats** - List of formats that are valid when providing an asset of the given type. URL and FILE formats are supported
* **overrides** - List of product fields whose value will be overrided by the plugin implementation, when a product spec is created including the asset

* **href** - URL that can be used to retrieve the information of the digital asset
* **version** - Version of the digital asset
* **contentType** - Media type of the digital asset (e.g application/pdf)
* **state** - Current status of the asset in its life cycle
* **location** - URL where it is possible to download the digital asset itself 
* **resourceType** - Type of digital asset chosen between the supported by the system
* **metadata** - A generic field with information provided by the owner of the asset

Additionally, for uploading assets the API manages the following fields:

* **isPublic** - Specifies whether the asset could be downloaded by any user or only by the authorized ones (typically the owner and customers if the assets has been included in a product)
* **content** - Object containing the file itself. This object includes the following fields:
    * **name** - Name of the asset file being uploaded

# Group Customer Management API

API for the management of customer information. This API is used for saving customer private information that cannot be included within the party resources. Concretely, this API is used jointly with *Customer Account*, and
*Billing Account* to maintain different shipping contact mediums (including, email, phone, and address) attached to different billing accounts.

This API manages the following fields:

* **id** - Id that identifies the customer object
* **href** - URL pointing to the customer info
* **name** - Username of the owner of the customer object. Note that this field maps the *id* field of the individual object
* **relatedParty** - Party which owns the Customer object
* **contactMedium** - List of contact mediums that define a shipping contact. This list has the same format as the contact medium described in the *Party Management API*, and must include an email, a telephone, and an address. In this case, this address is private and only vissible by sellers when they need it.
* **customerAccount** - Reference of the customer account attached to this customer object

Note that a complete shipping profile is created as a tuple of a Customer object, a Customer Account, and a Billing Account. In this way, the Billing account reference is included when creating an order (see **Order Management API** section),
the Billing Account includes a reference to a Customer Account which links to a Customer object. The later contains the contact medium chosen as shipping address for the order.

# Group Usage Management API

API for the management of Usage documents. Usage documents contain the actual usage made of an acquired product, including the information defined in its Usage Specification.

This API manages the following fields:

* **id** - Id that identifies the Usage
* **href** - URL pointing to the Usage
* **date** - Date and time when the usage was created
* **type** - Type of the Usage document. It refers to the name of an Usage Specification
* **description** - Description of the Usage Document
* **status** - Current status of the Usage
* **usageSpecification** - Reference to the Usage Specification that defines the current usage. It includes its id and its href
* **usageCharacteristic** - List with the values of the characteristics defined in the Usage Specification
* **relatedParty** - List of parties that are involved in the Usage. At least this list must include the user the made the usage of the service with the role *customer*
* **ratedProductUsage** - In case the customer had already been charged for the usage made in the current document, this field would contain the amount generated by the document, taking into account the pricing model of the product. This field contains the following fields:
    * **ratingDate** - Date and time when the document was rated
    * **usageRatingTag** - Fixed to *usage*
    * **isBilled** - Specifies if the rated document has been already charged
    * **ratingAmountType** - Fixed to *Total*
    * **taxIncludedRatingAmount** - Total amount generated by the Usage
    * **taxExcludedRatingAmount** - Amount without taxes generated by the Usage
    * **taxRate** - Tax rate of the rated amount
    * **currencyCode** - Currency of the rated amount
    * **productRef** - *href* of the product in the inventory that generated the rate
                
Note, that for a usage document to be processed and understood by the system, it is required to include some fields which must also be defined as characteristics of the Usage Specification. This fields are:

* **orderid** - Id of the order where the product was acquired
* **productid** - Id in the inventory of the product containing the details of the acquisition
* **correlationNumber** - Sequence number of the usage documents, used to ensure that no usage has been lost
* **unit** - Unit being monitored while accounting the service (e.g second, call, megabyte, etc)
* **value** - Usage made of the service of the given unit

*  **productClass** - Id of the Revenue Sharing Model. This field represents a group of services or applications whose revenues are distributed in the same way
*  **algorithmType** - ID of the algorithm that is used in this model
*  **aggregatorId** - Id of the aggregator that represents the Store instance where the applications and services are offered, and thus, must receive part of the revenues
*  **aggregatorValue** - Value of the aggregator in the Revenue Sharing Model
*  **stakeholders** - List of providers that are stakeholders of the applications and services included in a given product class, and thus, must receive part of the revenues. For each stakeholder the following fields are included:
